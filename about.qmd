This is a personal project to learn how to embed [Shinylive (Shiny + WebAssembly)](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html) in a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document. It is almost the exact copy of the [Todo List example](https://gshotwell.github.io/shiny-algorithm/#/static-code-analysis) (see the [code](https://github.com/gshotwell/shiny-algorithm/blob/main/apps/todo-list/app.py)) by [Gordon Shotwell](https://github.com/gshotwell).
